# Tapestree.jl

**Unravelling the evolutionary tapestry**:
[Tapestree] (https://github.com/ignacioq/Tapestree.jl) is a 
[Julia](http://julialang.org) package of phylogenetic analyses of 
diversification, trait and biogeographic dynamics.


## Package Features

Tapestree currently holds the following phylogenetic models:

  1. "Trait and Range Interspecific Biogeographic Evolution" (TRIBE): which implements a joint model of trait evolution and biogeographic history as described in Quintero, I., & Landis, M. J. (2020). Interdependent phenotypic and biogeographic evolution driven by biotic interactions. Systematic biology, 69(4), 739-755. [https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syz082](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syz082)

  2. "Environmental and State dependent Speciation and Extinction" (ESSE): which implements a joint geographic and environmental model of diversification as described in Quintero, I., Landis, M. J., Jetz, W., & Morlon, H. (2022). The build-up of the present-day tropical diversity of tetrapods. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2023. 120 (20) e2220672120.
