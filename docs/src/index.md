# Tapestree.jl

**Unraveling the evolutionary tapestry**:
[Tapestree] (https://github.com/ignacioq/Tapestree.jl) is a 
[Julia](http://julialang.org) package of phylogenetic analyses of 
diversification, trait and biogeographic dynamics.


## Package Features

Tapestree currently holds the following phylogenetic models:

  1. "Diffused Brownian motion" (DBM): implements speciation rates following a geometric Brownian motion with no extinction, constant extinction, constant turnover or extinction diffusion as described in Quintero, I. (in press). "The diffused evolutionary dynamics of morphological novelty". Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

  2. "Birth-Death Diffusion" (BDD): implements speciation rates following a geometric Brownian motion with no extinction, constant extinction, constant turnover or extinction diffusion as described in Quintero, I., Lartillot, N., & Morlon, H. (2024). "Imbalanced speciation pulses sustain the radiation of mammals". Science, 384, 1007-1012. [https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adj2793](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adj2793)

  3. "Trait and Range Interspecific Biogeographic Evolution" (TRIBE): implements a joint model of trait evolution and biogeographic history as described in Quintero, I., & Landis, M. J. (2020). Interdependent phenotypic and biogeographic evolution driven by biotic interactions. Systematic biology, 69(4), 739-755. [https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syz082](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syz082)

  4. "Environmental and State dependent Speciation and Extinction" (ESSE): implements a joint geographic and environmental model of diversification as described in Quintero, I., Landis, M. J., Jetz, W., & Morlon, H. (2022). The build-up of the present-day tropical diversity of tetrapods. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2023. 120 (20) e2220672120.
